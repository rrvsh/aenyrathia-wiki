# Dud

Dud began life as an Arquebus "Savant" model, intended for investigator work. During his neural imprint, a power surge fried a critical logic gate, leaving him with a limited processing capacity and a deep-seated aversion to corporate directives. Dumped in the streets for his "stubborn insubordination," Dud quickly learned that his warforged frame and natural combat programming were valuable assets.

He fell in with the Crimson Boys, not out of loyalty, but necessity. Emporer recognized Dud's potential as a bruiser and enforcer, but viewed him with wary suspicion. Dud, in turn, found the Crimson Boys' disorganized chaos frustrating to his remaining logic circuits, but tolerated their presence for the sake of shelter and the opportunity to indulge his newfound (and poorly understood) desire for personal autonomy. The partnership is purely transactional: they use Dud's fists, and he uses their resources, with a constant undercurrent of mutual distrust and simmering potential for betrayal. Dud knows that his former creators at Arquebus would likely want him deactivated, and if that means using the Crimson Boys to survive, so be it.
